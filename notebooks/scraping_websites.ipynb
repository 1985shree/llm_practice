      "As society changes, we are seeing more and more elderly parents living on their own – but this doesn’t have to be the case. In this article, we take a look at the growing trend of ‘old parent’ houses in Kottayam and explore how to promote meaningful community living instead. Read on to learn more about how to turn the tide on old age homes and help seniors live with dignity, support, and companionship in their twilight years!\n",
      "Introduction to the Issue of Old Age Homes in Kottayam\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking care of parents is considered to be the moral duty of every child. This value is embedded into the heart of every Indian citizen. There has been a significant transformation with respect to family structure in our society over some decades. Now, old age is often synonymous with loneliness and isolation. This is especially true in India, where the traditional joint family system is breaking down, and children are increasingly living away from their parents.\n",
      "Due to the transformation of social structure and with the nuclear family culture becoming the preferred family structure, there has been a rise in the number of old age homes in cities like Kottayam. Many elderly people are finding themselves living in old age homes, where they can receive the care and support they need.\n",
      "Reasons For The Increasing Trend of ‘Old Parents Only’ Houses\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary reason for children sending their elderly parents to old age homes is considered to be the migration to another city or country for better opportunities in their career, whether it is for a job or education. It is not much difficult for the youths to leave their parental house and migrate to a new place, but it is certainly challenging for the elderly parents to leave their hometowns and settle down in a new city and so they prefer to live in their home town.\n",
      "However, this is not the only reason for the development of old age homes in Kottayam.\n",
      "\n",
      "With improved medical facilities and advancements in senior care, seniors are living longer and healthier lives.\n",
      "Many seniors are choosing to downsize in their retirement years and live in smaller homes that are easier to manage. Additionally, as the children of baby boomers reach adulthood, they are often moving away from home to start families of their own, leaving their parents behind.\n",
      "Finally, the current economic climate has made it difficult for some families to afford two households, so they are opting to have their elderly parents move in with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, old age homes are not without their problems. Let’s take a deeper dive.\n",
      "Problems parents face in old age homes in India.\n",
      "As people age, they often times face different problems than they did when they were younger. For example, many seniors experience chronic health problems that can make everyday activities difficult. They may also have difficulty getting around and accessing the things they need.\n",
      "In India, these problems are compounded by the fact that many seniors live in old-age homes. These homes are often overcrowded and lack basic amenities. This can make it very hard for seniors to get the care and assistance they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there is often a lack of basic amenities and medical care. Many old age homes are understaffed and lack qualified medical personnel, which can lead to serious health problems going unnoticed or untreated.\n",
      "Second, old age homes can be incredibly isolating. Families may live far away from their elderly relatives, making it difficult to visit or even keep in touch. This isolation can compound the health problems that residents face, as they may not have anyone to confide in or turn to for support.\n",
      "Finally, the cost of living in an old age home can be prohibitively expensive for many families. While the monthly fee may be affordable, other costs, such as food and medical care, can quickly add up. This can put a significant financial strain on families who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problems that parents face in old age homes in India underscore the need for better support systems for the country’s elderly population.\n",
      "Benefits of Community Living in an Apartment over Old Age Home\n",
      "There are many benefits of community living in an apartment over an old age home.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can help to keep seniors active and engaged with the world around them.\n",
      "It can provide a sense of social support and companionship that can be lacking in an old age home.\n",
      "Community living can help to promote independence and allow seniors to maintain a level of control over their own lives.\n",
      "Living in an apartment, older adults also enjoy a level of privacy and autonomy, as well as the physical space required for comfortable daily living.\n",
      "Public transport and other amenities are often more easily accessible in an apartment complex than in a traditional old age home.\n",
      "Finally, it can provide opportunities for intergenerational exchange and support, which can be beneficial for both older adults and younger generations alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "It is also essential to recognize that old age homes are not the only answer when it comes to elderly care. Community living must be openly embraced and encouraged as a viable option, with older generations empowered to take charge of their living situations. With greater understanding and resources put into place for senior citizens, Kottayam can become a model for other cities in India, showcasing open-mindedness and kindness towards all its citizens, regardless of age. After all, age should never be an obstacle to respect and recognition. Creating a society where people of all ages interact on an open and respectful level is a step towards a better world for everyone. Let’s strive to make sure that the tide continues to turn in favor of community living so that our parents and grandparents can enjoy the peace, comfort, and respect they truly deserve.\n",

      "As society changes, we are seeing more and more elderly parents living on their own – but this doesn’t have to be the case. In this article, we take a look at the growing trend of ‘old parent’ houses in Kottayam and explore how to promote meaningful community living instead. Read on to learn more about how to turn the tide on old age homes and help seniors live with dignity, support, and companionship in their twilight years!\n",
      "Introduction to the Issue of Old Age Homes in Kottayam\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking care of parents is considered to be the moral duty of every child. This value is embedded into the heart of every Indian citizen. There has been a significant transformation with respect to family structure in our society over some decades. Now, old age is often synonymous with loneliness and isolation. This is especially true in India, where the traditional joint family system is breaking down, and children are increasingly living away from their parents.\n",
      "Due to the transformation of social structure and with the nuclear family culture becoming the preferred family structure, there has been a rise in the number of old age homes in cities like Kottayam. Many elderly people are finding themselves living in old age homes, where they can receive the care and support they need.\n",
      "Reasons For The Increasing Trend of ‘Old Parents Only’ Houses\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary reason for children sending their elderly parents to old age homes is considered to be the migration to another city or country for better opportunities in their career, whether it is for a job or education. It is not much difficult for the youths to leave their parental house and migrate to a new place, but it is certainly challenging for the elderly parents to leave their hometowns and settle down in a new city and so they prefer to live in their home town.\n",
      "However, this is not the only reason for the development of old age homes in Kottayam.\n",
      "\n",
      "With improved medical facilities and advancements in senior care, seniors are living longer and healthier lives.\n",
      "Many seniors are choosing to downsize in their retirement years and live in smaller homes that are easier to manage. Additionally, as the children of baby boomers reach adulthood, they are often moving away from home to start families of their own, leaving their parents behind.\n",
      "Finally, the current economic climate has made it difficult for some families to afford two households, so they are opting to have their elderly parents move in with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, old age homes are not without their problems. Let’s take a deeper dive.\n",
      "Problems parents face in old age homes in India.\n",
      "As people age, they often times face different problems than they did when they were younger. For example, many seniors experience chronic health problems that can make everyday activities difficult. They may also have difficulty getting around and accessing the things they need.\n",
      "In India, these problems are compounded by the fact that many seniors live in old-age homes. These homes are often overcrowded and lack basic amenities. This can make it very hard for seniors to get the care and assistance they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, there is often a lack of basic amenities and medical care. Many old age homes are understaffed and lack qualified medical personnel, which can lead to serious health problems going unnoticed or untreated.\n",
      "Second, old age homes can be incredibly isolating. Families may live far away from their elderly relatives, making it difficult to visit or even keep in touch. This isolation can compound the health problems that residents face, as they may not have anyone to confide in or turn to for support.\n",
      "Finally, the cost of living in an old age home can be prohibitively expensive for many families. While the monthly fee may be affordable, other costs, such as food and medical care, can quickly add up. This can put a significant financial strain on families who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problems that parents face in old age homes in India underscore the need for better support systems for the country’s elderly population.\n",
      "Benefits of Community Living in an Apartment over Old Age Home\n",
      "There are many benefits of community living in an apartment over an old age home.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can help to keep seniors active and engaged with the world around them.\n",
      "It can provide a sense of social support and companionship that can be lacking in an old age home.\n",
      "Community living can help to promote independence and allow seniors to maintain a level of control over their own lives.\n",
      "Living in an apartment, older adults also enjoy a level of privacy and autonomy, as well as the physical space required for comfortable daily living.\n",
      "Public transport and other amenities are often more easily accessible in an apartment complex than in a traditional old age home.\n",
      "Finally, it can provide opportunities for intergenerational exchange and support, which can be beneficial for both older adults and younger generations alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "It is also essential to recognize that old age homes are not the only answer when it comes to elderly care. Community living must be openly embraced and encouraged as a viable option, with older generations empowered to take charge of their living situations. With greater understanding and resources put into place for senior citizens, Kottayam can become a model for other cities in India, showcasing open-mindedness and kindness towards all its citizens, regardless of age. After all, age should never be an obstacle to respect and recognition. Creating a society where people of all ages interact on an open and respectful level is a step towards a better world for everyone. Let’s strive to make sure that the tide continues to turn in favor of community living so that our parents and grandparents can enjoy the peace, comfort, and respect they truly deserve.\n",
